# 🍷 Wine Quality Dataset Analysis

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of the **Wine Quality Dataset** sourced from Kaggle (2021, M Yasser H). The analysis is performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, covering data loading, inspection, cleaning, and visualization to explore the relationship between wine characteristics and quality ratings.

## 📁 Dataset

**File Used:** `WineQT.csv` (not included in the repo)  
**Source:** [Kaggle - Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset)

The dataset contains **1143 rows** and **13 columns** describing various physicochemical properties of red wine samples:

| Feature                 | Description                             |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `Id`                   | Unique identifier                       |
| `Fixed Acidity`        | Non-volatile acidity                    |
| `Volatile Acidity`     | Evaporative acid content                |
| `Citric Acid`          | Contributes to freshness                |
| `Residual Sugar`       | Sugar left after fermentation           |
| `Chlorides`            | Salt content                            |
| `Free Sulfur Dioxide`  | Free SO₂ in wine (preservative)         |
| `Total Sulfur Dioxide` | Total SO₂ (free + bound)                |
| `Density`              | Mass per unit volume                    |
| `pH`                   | Acidity/alkalinity level                |
| `Sulphates`            | Adds flavor, acts as preservative       |
| `Alcohol`              | Percentage of alcohol                   |
| `Quality`              | Quality rating (target variable)        |

## 🛠️ Tasks Performed

### ✅ 1. Data Loading
- Imported the dataset from Google Drive using `pandas`.

### 🔍 2. Data Inspection
- Checked shape: **(1143, 13)**
- Verified data types (mostly `float64`)
- Detected missing values (e.g., 36 in `fixed acidity`, 32 in `quality`)

### 🧹 3. Data Cleaning
- Imputed missing values using **median** to preserve data distribution and handle skewness.

### 📊 4. Visualization
- Created a **correlation heatmap** (`heatmap_beautiful.png`) using `seaborn`.

#### Key Correlation Insights:
- **Positive Correlations:**
  - `Fixed Acidity` & `Density`
  - `Free Sulfur Dioxide` & `Total Sulfur Dioxide`
- **Negative Correlations:**
  - `Volatile Acidity` & `Quality`
  - `pH` & `Fixed Acidity`
